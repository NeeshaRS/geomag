# geomag_IOMS-M2

Codes relevant to studying the magnetic tides of Earth's ionosphere and ocean.
Visit http://geomag.colorado.edu/IOMS-M2 for more information or to download the
geomagnetic data produced from numerical simulations of Earth's ionospheric and
oceanic geomagnetic tides.

These codes were written in 2016-2017 by Neesha R. Schnepf. If you use these codes
